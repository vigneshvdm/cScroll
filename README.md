cScroll
=======

This is a very light weight scroll bar plugin which helps user append data into a table format and apply scroll using jquery

The plugin has two parts

1. cGrid - appends the data in form of a table in html
2. cScroll - puts the content into a scrollbar, this is very light weight and is less than 100 lines of code
The objective is to give an idea of how simple it is to create plugins
the size of the js is less than 5kb and if compressed it will only be 2-3 kb :)
